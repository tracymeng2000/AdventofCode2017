# AdventofCode2017
For the last couple of years, a fun Christmas-theme programming contest called the Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/) has been held in December, and they're holding it again this year.

Every day at 9pm Pacific time they post a new programming question, and then you submit your answers. The questions often cover some interesting computer science topics, and the website keeps track of your progress.
